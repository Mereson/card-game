# Card Game
This is a card game built for the purple guild phase 1 project.


#### This project was built using flask, a pain in the ass framework especially for me.

The development command is flask run, you can also run flask run --debug if you are a developer an you want the server to reset if you make changes.

### What is this project 🤔?

It is a card game, you select the right pair of cards and are awarded a point for each correct guess.

Once the timer runs out or the score gets to 20 a form is shown to the user

The user can type their name into the form and their score is recorded for them in the database and shown in the score.html file.

### What was used to build this project 🤷🏾?
This project was built using 
* Html and pure css for the frontend
* Vanilla Javascript for the functionality
* Flask for form and database querying as well as routing
* SQL (sqlite3) for the database
* and finally Jinja! for html formatting


### End notes 🫠: 
``` 
Just use react, Flask is a pain in the ass.
Well not entirely, it is a cool backend tool especially for non backend developers like me.
```
